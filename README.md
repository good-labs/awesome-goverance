## Overview

Governance is important for organizations to establish norms for leadership,
 communication, lessential contribution, and transparency. If you are writing your
own governance model (a GOVERNANCE.md, perhaps?) you will do best to have 
a large set of examples to learn from. Features of governance models might include 
any or all of the following:

 - Membership Roles
  - Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)
  - Steering Committees
 - Communication Methods and Frequency
  - Decision Making
  - Conflict of Interest
  - Code of Conduct
 - Values
 - Contribution Guidelines
  - Protocol for Change
  - Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

The content of your governance is largely to depend on the specifics of your project.
The examples below can help to guide you to what is right for your community.
